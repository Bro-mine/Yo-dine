Yo-dine is a bot created to test several Lisp concepts (CL in particular).

The main target for the project is for Yo-dine to be a (semi) useful desktop assistant, I plan on implement some concepts of AI in it as I learn more about that, but for now, it'll probably work as an ELIZA or emacs doctor bootleg.

Another goal is to make it flexible enough so that it is able to be easily converted into a IRC bot, or really just a bot for any platform (although I'm planning on writing it on Common Lisp, which is not really that used anymore, so libraries for such other platforms may be lacking).

If CL or really any Lisp dialect doesn't work out well for me, an effort will be conducted to write it in Python.

DEFINING THE PROJECT MORE:

"A desktop assistant" is a really broad term. It is 100% going to be an ELIZA bootleg, but unlike ELIZA, it won't try to be a psychiatrist, but rather a personal assistant that helps you with daily tasks... Though that's not really descriptive either...

I don't know much about machine learning, so much of it will be hunting for keywords, and maybe storing them temporarily, then looking for patterns, through which he is able to muster a response.
